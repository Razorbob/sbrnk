Šbrnk - Experimental WebGPU based Game Engine 
Started during my Masters Degree @FH Technikum Vienna
I have 0 Knowledge of Game Engine, this is mainly my learning journey into Game Engine and XR

If someone is interested in contributing we can share a room in the mental Hospital.

## At the Moment
- Simple Entity Component System
- Simple Math Lib for Vector & Matrices
- Simple aspect based Gfx Engine
- Simple linear Physics Implementation with out collison detection/resolution

Simple Gravity demo:

## Next Steps
- Implementing Physics with collisions
- Implementing WebXR 
- Implementing Model Loader
- Implementing Web3 (IOTA/ETH) 
- Implementing Editor 
- Mental Hospital
